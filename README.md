# ForensicLens-A User-Friendly UI For The Volatility Framework

## Objectives
* This project aims to develop a wrapper graphical interface for the Volatility framework, focusing on enhancing usability for memory forensics and analysis.
* Participants will design and implement sample plugins to automate different aspects of memory analysis within the Volatility framework.
* The solution will utilize a REST API architecture, separating backend and frontend modules to ensure scalability and maintainability.
* Users will be able to perform, store, and securely manage historical analysis data through a web application interface.
* The project aims to streamline the process of memory forensics by integrating user-friendly graphical tools with the powerful capabilities of Volatility.


## Challenge

* Memory forensics is crucial in cybersecurity for uncovering malicious activities that evade traditional disk-based forensics.
* The Volatility framework is extensively used for memory analysis, offering a comprehensive range of tools and features.
* It is particularly adept at revealing insights from volatile memory dumps, such as running processes and network connections.
* However, its command-line interface can pose challenges for novice users due to its complexity.
* Additionally, there is a need for a centralized system within Volatility for storing historical analysis data, which could enhance usability and workflow efficiency in cybersecurity investigations.
